We build technological support for teachers based on our investigation utilizing multimodal data with machine learning techniques.\n\n\n\nTeacher Professional Development\n\nTeacher training – We build effective teacher training programs based on our research with a focus on pedagogical aspects in the context of the technology-enhanced learning environment."
